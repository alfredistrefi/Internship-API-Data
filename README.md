The project is a React application that retrieves cat facts from an API and presents them in a list. Users can click on a fact to view its details on a separate page. From the details page, users have the option to delete the selected fact. The application utilizes React Router for navigation and localStorage to store the fetched facts. It provides a simple and intuitive way for users to explore cat facts and manage their favorites.
